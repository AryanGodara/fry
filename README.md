# `Fry` - a functional reactive rhythm library

*This library is in an experimental state.*

The idea of `fry` is to deliver a set of operators for defining rhythms using *functional reactive programming* (FRP). 
FRP is really good for expressing time-semantics in a declarative way, so using it to build rhythmic machines is 
pretty obvious, though I havn't yet seen examples of this. The rhythms can control anything you like - for example 
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) via [OSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control). 

In the `examples` directory you can see how `fry` can be used.
